Hello, my name is Thierry Baasch and I am currently working as an Assistant Professor within Biomedical Engineering at Lund University.

In my research I focus on applying analytical and numerical modeling to enhance, optimize, and innovate acoustophoresis and other lab-on-a-chip applications. This is achieved through thorough experimental validation and carefully developed theories. Current projects aim at optimizing the throughput, efficiency, and reproducibility of acoustophoresis chips, as well as gaining additional control of the particle trajectories. His research interests include physical modeling and computational methods, e.g. acoustics, wave-motion, multibody and non-smooth mechanics, control theory, finite-element methods, and machine learning.
